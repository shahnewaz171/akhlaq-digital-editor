# pnpm configuration for build scripts

# Allow essential development dependencies to run build scripts

scripts-prepend-node-path=true
enable-pre-post-scripts=true

# Note: The ignored build scripts warning is for these safe packages:

# - @parcel/watcher: File watching for development

# - @swc/core: Fast TypeScript/JavaScript transpiler

# - @tailwindcss/oxide: TailwindCSS performance engine

# - esbuild: Fast JavaScript bundler used by Vite

# - sharp: Image processing library

# - unrs-resolver: Universal resolver for module resolution

#

# These are standard, trusted tools that compile native binaries for performance.

# The warning can be safely ignored as these packages are essential for builds.
